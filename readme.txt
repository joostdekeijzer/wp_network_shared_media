Allows you to use media from other blogs in a Multisite environment.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a new tab to the "Add Media" window, allowing you to access media in other blogs.

It can be very helpful when you use [Multisite Language Switcher](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/multisite-language-switcher/) plugin for setting up a multilingual site as it prevents the editors from having to upload images twice.

Based on a blogpost by [Aaron Eaton](http://blog.channeleaton.com/sharing-media-libraries-across-network-sites).

== Installation ==

* Download the plugin
* Uncompress it with your preferred unzip program
* Copy the entire directory in your plugin directory of your WordPress blog (/wp-content/plugins)
* Network-activate the plugin
* Edit a post or create a new one
* Open the Add Media popup -> see the new tab!

== Upgrade Notice ==

* I've dropped support for WordPress versions below 3.5
* There is an issue with the "edit image" functionality in the post editor of WordPress 3.9, please see the FAQ

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Editing an image in WordPress 3.9 shows the wrong image! =

Yes, I know :-(

Starting from WordPress 3.9, when editing an image in the post editor, the original image data is retrieved from the server using only the image id. Using NSM, this will be the ID from a different blog. When, by coincidence, the current blog also has an attachment with that ID, the information for that image is displayed.

v0.10.0 of my plugin has a fix for newly inserted images, but old embeds will not be changed (please see [this forum post](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/using-wordpress-39-editing-an-image-shows-the-wrong-information) for more info).

If you encounter this, the most straight-forward solution is to:

1. Cancel the image edit
2. Go to the text view of the post
3. When your image has a caption, clear the id attribute of the caption shortcode
4. Also remove the `wp-image-<id>` and `wp-att-<id>` classes from the image tag
5. Return to Visual mode and try and edit the image again

Sorry for the inconvenience...

= About Permissions =

This plugin depends on the global WordPress blog permissions for viewing and editing Media.

Only blogs where the user has 'upload_files' permission are shown in the Network Shared Media tab.

If a user doesn't have the 'upload_files' permission on the current (active) blog, the tab isn't shown at all since that user can't access the Add Media pop-up window.

= I still can't see the site listed! =

A site can have several attributes which can be set through /wp-admin/network/sites.php .

This plugin only shows sites which attributes are set as follows:

* Public: true
* Archived: false
* Spam: false
* Delete: false
* Mature: ignored

== Screenshots ==
1. New tab added to the Add Media popup window
2. The Network Shared Media tab lists the media per site
3. Show a selected image and "Insert into Post"
